## LED Panel

The LED panel is controlled by using the [`Adafruit CircuitPython NeoPixel`](https://docs.circuitpython.org/projects/neopixel/en/latest/) library, which is similar to the `FastLED` library generally used with mirocontrollers.

Installation is [here](https://docs.circuitpython.org/projects/neopixel/en/latest/).



```python
